# КЛЮЧЕВЫЕ ЦИТАТЫ ИЗ ЗВОНКА

## О проблеме и видении проекта

### Текущая ситуация на рынке
> "I've been shopping for weather graphics this year and all of them want like 15,000 for a computer hardware thing, 1500 a month for software licensing, even ones that advertise themselves as being affordable for solo entrepreneurs, they're not."

> "I mean, I don't know a single person that's like doing something on their own that could afford $2,000 a month plus 15k on like hard... Well, okay, maybe I do, but like it would be very rare."

### Целевая аудитория
> "I have a feeling if the people could afford all that, they wouldn't really even be doing weather in the first place, they would be like living on a beach enjoying their life."

### О конкурентах
> "This dude puts together these graphics, which are actually pretty impressive, but he does them in like Photoshop."

> "So it would be cool to like do something like this, whether it's designing our own layout template or contacting him about some sort of license or commercial use and then **feeding these graphics with AI data**."

### Основное видение
> "The goal would be just for people to be able to create their own show, whether it's exporting static files or exporting an MP4 or, you know, whatever they would need to do."

> "If we could make something like this where it becomes full screen and the browser remains as high definition, and let's say the broadcaster could either use OBS or pull it into a web browser and just make it full screen and then click through it like a PowerPoint or Google Slides."

> "I'm trying to make more of an affordable solution for people to subscribe and get graphics for their needs and they don't have to spend a fortune."

## О функциональности

### Map-based графика
> "The objective would be to allow people to... have some of these slides that people could like edit and then also more of a map centric one, like what you just showed me, where it would be like majority of the United States map and then animated, you know, precipitation, snow temperatures, and then you could draw symbols on it."

### Static template графика
> "It would be cool to like do something like this, whether it's designing our own layout template... the goal would be to have some of these slides that people could like edit."

> "They could select the city that they're in, there could be a space to select, I'm in Minneapolis, and then it would pull up data for Minneapolis. They needed to manually override some bits of information they could, but not necessarily what they need to do that."

### User experience
> "We have to consider that the people using this thing, no offense, they're going to probably be not that, not necessarily the most tech savvy people. And they need to be able to easily create their own show and export it."

### Login & Save system
> "I think if they had their own login account, like after they sign up, and then that way they can maybe save shows in some sort of a library or something. You know, it's just like, this is Monday's show, this is Tuesday's, and then they can... I mean, I'm sure there's little logistics that would need to be ironed out."

## О демо и подходе

### Реакция на мое демо
> "I mean, I like the button clicking and the placement, like that's all like That's on the right track for sure."

> "The fact that you did that map is really, it's a promising start."

### О фронтах
> "Now the cold fronts and the warm fronts, usually they're more like curved and you would need to angle them in such a manner. So that would need some adjustments."

---

## О процессе работы

### Milestone подход
> "I mean, I've had a number of these projects where I've worked through milestones. So I'm clear on that part."

> "I don't know what a typical timeline for something like this would be, but I would just say I'd like to try to get it out there for, you know, testing and advertising and getting people able to use it within the next one to two months."

### О timeline
> "I mean, and I used to do web project management way back in the day. So I know it's like client changes, everything like that can add to the timeline. But **as long as it's like constantly moving forward, I think that's the main thing**."

### О скорости
> "I have some guys on here that are sending me messages. Like we can have this done in seven days. I'm like, to me... That seems really fast. Are you sure?"

**Его ожидание**: 1-2 месяца для MVP

## О существующем прототипе

### AI-generated код
> "I had AI produce, like, prototype codes, so ChatGPT says that it's provided 60% of the, you know, stuff. I'm like, oh, okay, well, we'll see about that. So I'll upload that to the post and people can look at it."

**ACTION ITEM** (из звонка): Клиент должен был загрузить AI прототип код в пост

---

## О его прошлом опыте на Upwork

### Burned projects
> "I just want somebody that's confident in it and knows what they're doing in that way, because **I've had a lot of burned projects on this platform**, not to say that that's going to be you, but, you know, a lot of people that say they're capable, then they're not."

### Про scope
> "I've learned that the hard way on Upwork. Some, you know, there's some things that I would consider obvious, but others don't consider obvious. So it's, it's. **It's very, it needs to be spelled out very clearly**."

> "Maybe I need to add a couple of things to the listing to just like, I don't know that I heavily enough put in the job posting that I need, like kind of these graphics to be modified."

## Что он ожидает в следующем пропозале

### Мои action items из звонка
> "Yeah, send me whatever you want to send me. I'm going to review some more stuff today on this and just kind of fine tune the scope."

> "Put together your proposal based on this chat and just, you know, if there's any questions you have or loose ends."

> "Take a look at the requirements, the link I sent you, as far as getting some sort of look established that can be pulling in the data."

# ВАЖНЫЕ ИНСАЙТЫ

## ✅ Что ему понравилось в моем подходе
1. Я сделал рабочее демо ДО применения
2. Демо показывает понимание технических требований
3. Timeline реалистичный (3-4 недели, реально 1-1.5 месяца)
4. Я понимаю milestone-based подход

## ⚠️ На что обратить внимание
1. Он burned на Upwork раньше - нужна уверенность и четкость
2. Scope должен быть очень детальным
3. Он технически подкован - не нужно упрощать объяснения
4. Ему важна постоянная коммуникация и forward движение
5. Он сам будет использовать инструмент (личная заинтересованность)

## 🎯 Что должно быть в финальном пропозале
1. **Очень детальный scope** с разбивкой на части
2. **Четкие milestones** с deliverables
3. **Realistic timeline** (не обещать 7 дней)
4. **Questions для clarification** по обоим типам графики (maps + static templates)
5. **Tech stack предложение**
6. **Как будем работать с его AI-generated кодом** (если он его пришлет)
7. **План по интеграции с Xweather API**
8. **Approach к static template graphics** (это было менее детально описано в оригинальном посте)
